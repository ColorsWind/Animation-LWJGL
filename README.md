# Animation-LWJGL

This re.pository is my homework in computer graphics course, which build an animation using a sequence of model. The project consists of two animations with different background. In addition, I make an interactive edit menu by Swing, so you can  modify geometric transformation in time. I hope these can  help those who are learning [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/).



## Platform

- Windows x64
- MacOS arm64



## Overview of technology

LWJGL is a Java library that enables cross-platform access to OpenGL (Vulkan is also supported, but only OpenGL is used here). Although the graphics card cannot directly access the memory allocated by the JVM virtual machine, we can directly apply for "native memory" to communicate with the graphics card through `ByteBuffer`. In this way, accessing the API of OpenGL through Java is no different from using `glad` in C++.

In order to refresh the picture at a constant frame rate, we use vertical synchronization technology.

LWJGL provides Java binding of `assimp`. We use [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) to read the model file.

Due to the relationship of time, the interactive menu does not use OpenGL to draw the hub, but simply calls swing to complete the drawing. thread managed by LWJGL and Swing transaction thread use Java's built-in lock (`synchronized` keyword) to synchronize.

- `W`, `S`, `A`, `D` to move
- mouse movement to control perspective
- `left mouse button` to capture / release cursor
- `M` to show settings
- `ESC` to release cursor
